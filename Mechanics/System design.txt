Design architecture
Divide the parts in categories to reuse them 

- part
- components : a simple system made from several parts
- module: a complex system, made from parts and components, and can be reused in several vhc, like engine module, suspension module,

Skeleton

Design skeletton

for each system, it would be wise to build up a simple skeletton.

this skeletton is an abstraction of the system. 
each component is represented by a cube, sphere, etc...
the idea is that these shapes represents the maximum size of each components and where are connected to each other. 
this representation give an idea of the size of the whole system and ensures that the general shape is respected.

each component is designed in order to not exceed the allocated size. 

through the design process, the skeletton can be adjusted according to the specification. it is possible to check on the main assembly that there is not volumic conflict.
