Prefabricated parts PFP /premanufactured parts PMP
Instead of creating the same parts again and again, design the components and make them easily modifiable. Then add them to the system in the assembly
Example : threads : try the smallest possible size, for example M3 to M20. 
Test them with small parts and check the tolerances. 
The next step is to prepare small parts ready to be added to system parts. The final step is the merge the bodies. 


Threaded hole
Table : 
Screw |	Threaded hole diameter | Bore Hole (clearance)
M3    |  2.8			| 3.2

Clearance
To fix two part together, a clearance is needed.
When two parts must be assembled together, a clearance of 0.1mm is enough. Then use the glue to fix the assembly.
